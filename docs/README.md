# Spike

Spike is a numerical toolset for the simulation of integrate-and-fire neurons. 
It is a library that implements important statistics such as the firing rate, coefficient of variation as well as several spectral statistics such as the power spectrum.
Furthermore it contains some executables that calculate the susceptibility of an integrate-and-fire neuron to an applied white noise signal.

**Disclaimer:** The code presented here is a work in progress and is subject to frequent change as it is currently used by the author for his main_process thesis.
