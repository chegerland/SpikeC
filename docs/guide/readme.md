# Introduction

$$J \left( \theta_0, \theta_1 \right) = \frac{1}{2m}\sum\limits_{i=1}^m \left( h_{\theta}(x^{(i)})-y^{(i)} \right)^{2}$$


**Spike** is a toolset for simulating integrate-and-fire neurons and evaluating the resulting spike trains using all kinds of statistics.
It is written as a library with which you can write your own executables, but also comes with some *apps* out of the box.
Spike is unit tested and open sourced under the MIT License, you can find the source code at github.com/chegerland/spike.
